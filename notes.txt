Notes about redesigning the mathstructures pages

1. Move them to github

2. Use JSON for data about categories, objects and morphisms

3. Define a category by extending other categories with additional operations, relations and axioms

4. Allow several equivalent definitions

5. Main categories that are used as base categories for extensions:
  * Alg(n1,n2,...)     category of algebras with operations of arity n1,n2,...
  * Semigroups
  * Monoids
  * Groups
  * Semirings
  * Rings
  * Fields
  * Lattices
  * Bounded lattices
  * Distributive lattices
  * Bounded distributive lattices
  * Heyting algebras
  * Boolean algebras
  * Residuated lattices
  * FL-algebras
